## Scientific Programming - Task 3
Problem statement: for a given N and h, A, B, and f(x), write code to generate the tridiagonal matrix and right hand side vector needed to find the approximations of the BVP

Notes:
- Pick your own f(x), A, B, find the exact solution to the bvp u'' = f, u(0)=A, u(1)=B. 
- run your code with N=10, N=20, N=40, use your exact solution to see if the errors go down by a factor of 4 each time N is doubled.
